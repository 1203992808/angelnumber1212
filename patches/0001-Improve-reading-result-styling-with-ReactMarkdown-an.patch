+## Personalized Angel Number 1212 Reading Feature
+
+The website includes a personalized reading feature that uses Google's Gemini AI to generate custom interpretations of the angel number 1212 based on user inputs. To enable this feature:
+
+1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
+2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` to `.env.local`
+3. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
+4. Uncomment the Gemini API code in `src/app/api/generate-reading/route.ts`
+
+This feature allows users to get personalized spiritual guidance based on their age, gender, and specific life areas they'd like guidance on.

+The angels are guiding you to trust your intuition about relationship decisions in the coming months. When faced with choices, quiet your mind and listen to the subtle guidance that comes through feelings rather than thoughts.
+
+Pay particular attention to recurring themes in your dreams and any synchronicities involving couples or pairs—these are divine signposts guiding you toward balance.

+
+The recurring appearance of this number in your awareness field suggests that your spiritual guides recognize you've been working through significant relationship lessons in this lifetime. At age ${formData.age}, you've developed certain patterns in how you give and receive love that were necessary for your earlier soul development, but now require evolution to match your expanding consciousness.
+
+What's especially significant about seeing 1212 now is that it indicates you're being prepared for a relationship that will serve as a spiritual catalyst rather than just an emotional or physical partnership. This connection—whether with a current partner or someone yet to enter your life—will challenge you to grow beyond comfortable patterns and embrace a higher octave of love consciousness.
+
+Your guides are showing that you've been operating from a particular "love blueprint" that was formed through your early experiences and past relationships. This blueprint contains both wisdom and limitations.

+
+3. **Day 3: Self-Love Inventory** - Create two detailed lists: "Ways I Show Love to Others" and "Ways I Show Love to Myself." Notice any imbalances and commit to three specific actions to balance these energies.
+
+4. **Day 4: Communication Upgrade** - Identify one relationship where communication feels challenging. Write down three specific phrases you can use to express your needs more authentically while maintaining connection.
+
+5. **Day 5: Energetic Decluttering** - Symbolically release attachments to past relationships by writing names on small papers and burning them safely (or dissolving in water), setting the intention to transform these energies.
+
+6. **Day 6: Boundary Reinforcement** - Practice saying "no" to a small request without explanation or apology, just to exercise your boundary-setting muscles. Notice how it feels in your body.
+
+7. **Day 7: Attraction Alignment** - Create a detailed visualization of the quality of relationships you wish to attract, focusing on how these relationships feel rather than specific characteristics of the people involved.`,

+
+**Next 12 Days:** You'll likely notice subtle signs pointing toward relationship patterns that need attention. Pay particular attention to recurring thoughts or dreams about relationships during this window.
+
+**Next 12 Weeks:** This period offers a powerful opportunity for healing relationship wounds from the past. Old connections may resurface briefly, not necessarily for reconciliation, but for closure and integration of lessons.
+
+**Next 12 Months:** The foundation you build during this year will set the stage for significantly deeper connections. This is a divinely orchestrated preparation phase—each relationship experience is calibrating your energy to align with connections that match your authentic vibration.
+
+During the ${currentDate.getMonth() < 6 ? "latter" : "early"} part of this year, be especially attentive to "coincidental" meetings, as these may contain important relationship catalysts designed to accelerate your growth.

+Remember that angel number 1212 signifies perfect timing—trust that relationships are developing at precisely the right pace for your highest evolution, even when progress seems slow or challenging.`

+
+There's a strong indication that you may soon find yourself at a career crossroads where listening to your intuition will be crucial. The angelic realm is signaling that opportunities aligned with your soul purpose are either present now or will manifest soon, but you must be attuned to recognize them.

Also, be alert to potential mentors or collaborators who cross your path, especially those who embody both leadership and service.

+At ${formData.age}, you stand at a particularly significant threshold where your accumulated skills, wisdom, and life experience can now be channeled into work that resonates with your deepest truth. The repeated pattern of 1 and 2 in this angel number indicates you're being called to balance individuality with cooperation, innovation with tradition, and personal ambition with collective contribution.
+
+What makes this moment especially powerful is that the veil between your conscious awareness and your soul's deeper knowing about your purpose is thinning. Ideas, inspirations, or opportunities appearing now contain seeds of your authentic calling, even if they seem unexpected or unrelated to your current path.
+
+The divine realm is showing that you may have been operating on a career trajectory that was appropriate for an earlier phase of your life but may now feel increasingly misaligned with your evolving self. This misalignment isn't accidental—it's creating necessary tension to propel you toward work that allows fuller expression of your gifts.
+
+Your unique soul signature contains abilities that the world needs now.

+
+5. **Intuitive Career Visualization**: Spend 20 minutes in a relaxed state imagining yourself 3 years in the future doing deeply fulfilling work. Journal in detail about the environment, activities, people, and impact of this work.
+
+6. **Resistance Mapping**: Identify your top 3 fears about pursuing more purposeful work. For each fear, create a specific contingency plan that addresses the realistic aspect while releasing the emotional charge.
+
+7. **Daily Inspiration Practice**: Each morning for 12 days, read something related to your field of interest or listen to interviews with innovators in areas that fascinate you before checking email or news.
+
+8. **Micro-Purpose Projects**: Identify one small project you can complete in 1-2 hours that combines your skills with meaningful contribution. Complete at least two such projects this week.
+
+9. **Financial Alignment Planning**: Create a realistic assessment of financial needs, savings, and potential transition timeline if you're considering a significant career change.
+
+10. **Mentorship Seeking**: Identify someone who has successfully navigated a similar transition to what you're contemplating and reach out for guidance.

+
+**Integration Phase (1-3 Months)**: During this period, you'll likely notice increasing synchronicities related to your authentic path. What seem like coincidences—repeatedly hearing about certain fields, unexpected introductions to key people, or resources appearing at just the right moment—are actually divinely orchestrated guideposts.
+
+**Preparation Period (3-6 Months)**: This window is optimal for developing necessary skills, researching options, and laying practical groundwork for your next steps. Focus on incremental progress rather than dramatic change during this phase.
+
+**Significant Opportunity Window (6-12 Months)**: The angelic realm indicates that a meaningful opportunity aligned with your purpose is likely to manifest within this timeframe. This may come through unexpected channels, so remain open while continuing to take consistent action toward your vision.
+
+**Full Alignment (1-2 Years)**: While immediate shifts may occur, the complete integration of your authentic purpose into your professional life is a process that will unfold over this longer timeline. Trust that each step is perfectly timed, even during periods that seem slow or challenging.
+
+Remember that seeing 1212 indicates you're already on your path—these aren't changes you need to force but rather an evolution that's naturally unfolding as you remain conscious and responsive to divine guidance.`

+The appearance of angel number 1212 in relation to your financial life carries profound significance that extends far beyond material concerns.

The 1212 sequence indicates you're at a critical juncture where these patterns can be transformed at their core, not merely at the surface level of behaviors.
+
+What's particularly significant about this timing is that you're being called to heal ancestral patterns related to abundance. Many of your deepest beliefs about wealth weren't originally yours—they were inherited from family systems, cultural conditioning, and collective consciousness.

+### 12-Day Abundance Activation Protocol
+
+1. **Prosperity Consciousness Audit**: Spend 30 minutes journaling about your earliest memories of money and wealth. Identify key phrases you heard about money growing up and how these might still be influencing your relationship with abundance.
+
+2. **Limiting Belief Transformation**: Identify your top 3 limiting beliefs about money (e.g., "Money is scarce," "Wealth requires struggle"). For each, create an empowering alternative (e.g., "Abundance flows easily when I'm aligned with my purpose") and write it 12 times each morning.
+
+3. **Energy Center Clearing**: Focus on your root chakra (base of spine) and solar plexus (stomach area) through daily 10-minute meditation. These energy centers govern security and personal power—essential components of financial wellbeing.
+
+4. **Gratitude Amplification Practice**: Create a "prosperity inventory" listing everything in your life that represents abundance (not just financial). Review and add to this list daily, feeling genuine gratitude for each item.
+
+5. **Receiving Exercise**: Challenge yourself to accept three compliments, gifts, or offers of help each day without deflecting or immediately trying to reciprocate. Notice any discomfort and breathe through it.
+
+6. **Value Exchange Alignment**: Review how you're compensated for your work/services. Are you charging appropriately for your time and expertise? Create a plan to adjust any imbalances.
+
+7. **Abundance Visualization**: Spend 12 minutes each morning visualizing yourself with comfortable financial resources, focusing on the feeling of security, freedom, and generosity this creates.
+
+8. **Money Relationship Healing**: Write a letter to money as if it were a person with whom you have a relationship. Express your feelings honestly, then write a response from money to you.
+
+9. **Conscious Spending Practice**: For one week, before each purchase, pause and ask: "Does this expenditure align with my values and contribute to my wellbeing or that of others?"
+
+10. **Prosperity Affirmation Walk**: Take a 20-minute walk while repeating affirmations that align with your new abundance consciousness. The rhythmic movement helps integrate these new beliefs.
+
+11. **Generosity Practice**: Identify three ways you can give from a place of genuine abundance rather than obligation or depletion. Implement at least one this week.
+
+12. **Financial Vision Creation**: Develop a clear, detailed vision for your ideal relationship with money 3 years from now. Focus on how you'll feel and what you'll be able to create or contribute, rather than specific amounts.`,

+### Divine Timing for Your Abundance Evolution
+
+The angel number 1212 carries specific guidance about how your relationship with prosperity will unfold:
+
+**Foundation Period (Next 12 Days)**: This is a crucial window for consciousness work around abundance. The energy patterns you establish during this period will significantly influence your financial trajectory moving forward. Focus intensely on addressing limiting beliefs and establishing new thought patterns.
+
+**Energy Shift Phase (2-6 Weeks)**: During this period, you may notice subtle shifts in how you feel about money and prosperity. While external circumstances might not change dramatically yet, your internal relationship with abundance is being recalibrated.
+
+**Synchronicity Window (2-3 Months)**: Watch for meaningful coincidences related to finances—unexpected opportunities, resources, or connections may appear. These aren't random but are divine responses to your shifting energy field.
+
+**Testing Period (3-6 Months)**: You might face situations that trigger old scarcity beliefs. These aren't setbacks but opportunities to practice your new abundance consciousness under pressure. Your response to these challenges will determine how quickly your external reality shifts.
+
+**Manifestation Acceleration (6-12 Months)**: If you've been consistent with your internal work, this period often brings more tangible shifts in your financial situation. The seeds planted earlier begin to sprout in visible ways.
+
+**Complete Pattern Transformation (1-3 Years)**: The full renovation of your relationship with abundance is a deeper process that unfolds over this longer timeline. Each cycle brings greater alignment between your consciousness and your material experience.

+### 12-Day Personal Transformation Protocol
+
+1. **Identity Inventory**: Set aside 45 minutes to list all the roles and identities you embody (e.g., professional title, family roles, personality traits). For each, reflect: "Is this who I truly am, or is it a role I play?" Note which feel authentically aligned versus which feel constrictive.
+
+2. **Values Clarification Exercise**: Identify your top 5 core values (e.g., authenticity, compassion, growth). For each value, rate (1-10) how fully you're currently expressing it in your daily life, and identify one specific way to align more deeply.
+
+3. **Shadow Dialogue Practice**: Choose one quality you tend to judge in others. Journal a conversation with this trait, recognizing how it might exist in disowned aspects of yourself and what gifts it might offer when integrated consciously.
+
+4. **Life Review Timeline**: Create a visual timeline of your life highlighting pivotal moments of challenge and growth. Look for recurring themes that reveal your soul's curriculum in this lifetime.
+
+5. **Morning Consciousness Ritual**: For the next 12 days, spend the first 20 minutes after waking in contemplative practice: 5 minutes meditation, 5 minutes gratitude, 5 minutes setting intentions, 5 minutes visualizing your highest expression for the day.
+
+6. **Triggered Awareness Practice**: When emotionally triggered, implement the 4-4-4 technique: breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, then ask: "What belief about myself is being activated now? Is this belief ultimately true?"
+
+7. **Inner Child Healing Session**: Spend 30 minutes in meditation visualizing yourself at a challenging age. Listen to what this younger self needs to tell you, offer the compassion and wisdom they needed then, and visualize integration of this aspect.
+
+8. **Authentic Expression Challenge**: Identify one area where you've been holding back your truth. Take one concrete step toward more authentic expression, starting with something that feels challenging but manageable.
+
+9. **Digital Consciousness Fast**: For 24 hours (or start with 8 if that feels overwhelming), disconnect from all digital devices. Use this time to reconnect with your inner voice through nature, creativity, or contemplation.
+
+10. **Conscious Relationship Pattern Breaking**: Identify one relationship dynamic you tend to repeat. Create a specific plan for how you'll respond differently next time this pattern arises.
+
+11. **Sacred Space Creation**: Designate a small area in your home as a personal sanctuary. Include elements representing earth, air, fire, and water, as well as meaningful symbols of your authentic self.
+
+12. **Future Self Dialogue**: Through writing or recorded speech, create a dialogue with your evolved self 7 years from now. Ask for guidance about your current evolutionary edge and listen for the wisdom that emerges.`,

+### Divine Timing for Your Personal Evolution
+
+The angel number 1212 offers specific guidance about the unfolding timeline of your personal transformation:
+
+**Integration Window (Next 12 Days)**: This is a particularly potent period for pattern recognition and integration work. The veils between your conscious and unconscious mind are thinner, allowing greater access to insights about your core patterns. Pay special attention to dreams during this window.
+
+**Release Phase (2-6 Weeks)**: During this period, you may notice emotions or memories arising that have been suppressed. This isn't regression but a necessary clearing process. Old energies are surfacing to be acknowledged and released with compassion.
+
+**Void Space (2-3 Months)**: After releasing old patterns, you may experience a transitional period that feels uncertain or empty. This "void space" is essential—it creates room for new aspects of your authentic self to emerge. Resist the temptation to fill this space with busyness or distraction.
+
+**New Growth Phase (3-6 Months)**: During this window, new aspects of your authentic self begin to emerge more clearly. You may discover interests, perspectives, or qualities that surprise you. These aren't random but represent your soul's true nature becoming more accessible.
+
+**Testing and Strengthening (6-12 Months)**: This period often brings situations that test your new patterns and perspectives. These challenges aren't setbacks but opportunities to strengthen your authentic expression under varying conditions.
+
+**Embodiment and Integration (1-3 Years)**: The full integration of your authentic self is a deeper process that unfolds over this longer timeline. Each cycle brings greater alignment between your inner essence and outer expression.
+
+Remember that seeing 1212 indicates divine orchestration—your evolution is unfolding in perfect timing with cosmic forces that support your highest development. Trust the process, especially during periods that feel challenging or unclear.`

+3. **Projection Recognition Exercise**: List qualities you strongly admire or dislike in others. For each quality, reflect honestly: "How might this quality exist within me, either expressed or unexpressed?" Look especially for disowned positive traits.
+
+4. **Energy Clearing Ritual**: Create a simple ritual to clear relationship energies at day's end. This might involve visualization, brief meditation, or symbolic gestures that help you release interpersonal tensions rather than carrying them forward.
+
+5. **Active Listening Challenge**: In three different conversations this week, practice radical presence—focus completely on understanding the other person rather than formulating your response. Notice how this shifts the quality of connection.

+6. **Communication Pattern Interrupt**: Identify one habitual communication pattern that creates distance rather than connection (e.g., defensiveness, advice-giving, changing the subject). Create a specific plan for how you'll pause and choose differently.

+9. **Ancestral Wisdom Connection**: Create a simple altar honoring your spiritual lineage (which may be different from your biological lineage). Through meditation, request guidance and support from those who have walked a similar path before you.

+
+Trust that seeing 1212 repeatedly is celestial confirmation that you are being divinely guided and supported. This number sequence is appearing as reassurance that even during challenges, you are exactly where you need to be on your soul's journey.
+
+In the coming weeks, pay special attention to thoughts or ideas that come to you around 12:12 (both AM and PM), as the angelic energy is particularly strong at these times. Also notice any dreams involving the number 12 or patterns of two, as these contain additional guidance for you.
+
+Remember that you are never alone on this journey. Your angels, spirit guides, and higher self are constantly supporting you, sending love and wisdom to light your path.
+
+With divine light and sacred guidance,
+
+**Your Angel Number 1212 Guide**
